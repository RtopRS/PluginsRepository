    <strong>The official repository for Rtop plugins.</strong>
</h3>

## Disclaimer
Since the plugins come from git repositories on which we don't necessarily have rights, we can only certify the security of a plugin at a given moment. 

So we are not responsible for the security of the plugins and we are not responsible if a plugin causes problems. But we still make regular checks of the plugins present on this repository and we only add plugins developed by developers we think are trustworthy. 

**We advise you to check the code of a plugin before installing/upgrading it.** 

There are plugins on this repository that contain a `verified` key, these plugins are perfectly safe since only plugins developed by the Rtop team contain this key, besides RTPM will display a warning for all plugins not containing this key.

## Add a plugin
For the moment it is impossible, we will contact you in case your plugin could be added on the official repository. This could potentially change in the future.

## RTPM
In order to simplify the installation of plugins, we have developed the RTPM (Rtop Plugin Manager) software, which allows you to install and update plugins extremely easily.

### Install RTPM
Refer to the [**wiki**](https://github.com/RtopRS/RtopPluginManager/wiki/Installation) which contains all the instructions according to your OS.

### Use RTPM
Refer to the [**wiki**](https://github.com/RtopRS/RtopPluginManager/wiki/Use) which lists, describes and gives examples of the use of each command.
